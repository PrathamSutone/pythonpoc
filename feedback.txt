### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### 1. Identify Distinct Objects
- **Design (1st Image):**
  - Card Background: Bright yellow with rounded corners.
  - Text Elements: "VISA", card number ending in “3241”, "Total Balance", balance amount "$214,453.00".
  - Hidden icon near the card number.
  
- **Code's Output (2nd Image):**
  - Card Background: Bright yellow with rounded corners.
  - Text Elements: "VISA", card number ending in “3241”, "Total Balance", balance amount "$214,453.00".
  
#### 2. Location Relative to Frame Boundaries
- **Design:**
  - Text is centered within the card, with balanced margins around all sides.
  - The hidden icon is next to the card number.
  
- **Code's Output:**
  - The card is located in the bottom left of the frame, not centrally placed.
  - Text is slightly offset to the left, not as well aligned compared to the design.

#### 3. Size of Each Object Compared to Others
- **Design:**
  - The balance amount is the largest text element.
  - "VISA" is relatively smaller but prominent.
  - The card number and "Total Balance" are smaller than the balance amount, but clear.

- **Code's Output:**
  - The balance amount is not as large compared to other elements.
  - Text size consistency (relative to the design) is off.

#### 4. Spatial Relationships Between Objects
- **Design:**
  - Balance amount is emphasized with size.
  - Text is evenly spaced and well-aligned.
  
- **Code's Output:**
  - Text elements are closer together and not as well spaced out as the design.
  
#### 5. Recommendations for Improvement
To better match the code’s output to the design:

- **Center Positioning:**
  - Center the card within the frame for balanced aesthetics.
  
- **Text Alignment:**
  - Adjust the text alignment for more precise spacing and alignment relative to the card’s boundaries.
  
- **Text Sizing:**
  - Increase the size of the balance amount to match the emphasis in the design.
  
- **Add Hidden Icon:**
  - Include the hidden icon next to the card number for completeness.
  
- **Spacing:**
  - Ensure that text is evenly spaced and centered vertically and horizontally within the card.
